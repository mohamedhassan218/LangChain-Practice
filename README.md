# LangChain Practice

In this repo, I'll push all projects that I've implemented during learning to use LangChain to use the Large Language Models (LLMs) to build specific-tasks projects.

I've noticed that most of the tutorials and articles uses LangChain with the OpenAI but this is not avaliable for everyone. So in this repo, I'll use open-source LLMs from Hugging Face. May be in the future I'll use OpenAI but mainly we'll use open-source LLMs.

I'll put all resources I've used to build projects in this repo.
